# Introduction

Welcome to **GeoPol**!

**GeoPol** is a modded Minecraft server featuring VMW, and revolves around faction warfare and geopolitics. Players can form factions, trade or go to war with each other. 

Want to wage guerilla warfare in the mountains? You can do that. Want to build road systems, electric lines and other infrastructure? You can do that. Maybe form alliances or make enemies, or drive tanks and fly attack helicopters? You can do that. **GeoPol** is for anyone who is interested in geopolitics, history and warfare, all in Minecraft with a growing community of multiple factions.
