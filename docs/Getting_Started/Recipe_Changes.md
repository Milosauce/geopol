# Recipe Changes

This page contains information about recipe changes on the server.

We changed recipes to gate certain items with stupidly easy recipes, so that you can't craft them in the normal way. This is done to prevent players from getting these items too early in the game. Usually they require more resources and investments into other mods. Also, some of these items are not balanced for our progression and the server, so we decided to change them.

*These changes will not be applyed and visible if the scripts are not installed on the client. (You still can't craft it in the normal way, it's just not visible in JEI)*
