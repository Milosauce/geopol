# Joining

**There is currently 1 way to join our server.**

## General Information

We provide the modpack to our players to ease the joining process. ~~Currently we have two versions:~~ 
**(We're only focused on 1 version. The Extras modpack might come later.)**
- **Normal** (Includes every required mod and the custom scripts. Less storage required)
- ~~**Extras** (Features in Normal + Multiple optimization mods to help the client performance)~~

Modification for a unfair advantage is cheating and bannable. This includes certain Texture Packs. (I.e: Xray, Invisibly Be Gone)   

The modpack gets updated regularly. When this happens, an update will be required. More on this below.

## Ram

We recommend at least 6GB of RAM due to the amount of mods and assets. If you have more than 6GB available, feel free to allocate more RAM (8GB or even 10GB is fine) This will help with performance and will reduce lag.

To change the amount of RAM given to each Minecraft instance in the Curseforge launcher, head over to the settings button localted in the lower right corner. Then click on Minecraft, scroll down and change the amount with the slider.

## Curseforge Install

To install the modpack, open your favorite launcher and search for GeoPol. From here it will install the latest version. Note that you will also need to install **Optifine** separately if you want to use shaders. [More on this.](https://docs.geopolmc.org/docs/Mods/vicsmodernwarfare#shaders) In the event of a modpack update, press the two arrows next to the "Play" button and download the newest version. [More info on updating](https://support.curseforge.com/en/support/solutions/articles/9000206622-how-to-update-change-a-modpack-s-version)   

Alternatively, you can install the modpack from the [**Curseforge Website**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/geopol), but you will need to manually import the zip file into your launcher.
