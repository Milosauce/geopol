# Joining

**There are currently 3 ways to join our server.**

## General Information

We provide the modpacks to our players to ease the joining process. Currently we have two versions:
- **Normal** (Includes every required mod and the custom scripts. Less storage required)
- **Extras** (Features in Normal + Multiple optimization mods to help the client performance)

Both versions are free to download, although modifying them for a unfair advantage is bannable    

These can only be found on the [**Discord**](https://discord.geopolmc.org). The modpacks get updated regularly. When this happens, everyone has to redownload and import them again in their preferred launcher. More on this below.

We will apply for an official modpack on Curseforge after MW gets fully released. When this happens, it will be available directly from the Curseforge search bar.
## Ram

We recommend at least 6GB of RAM due to the amount of mods and assets. If you have more than 6GB available, feel free to increase the RAM to 8GB or even 10GB. This will help with performance and reduce the amount of lag.

## Curseforge Install

To install the modpack, open your favourite launcher and search for GeoPol. From here you can install the latest version. Note that you will also need to install Vic's Modern Warfare and Optifine separately. You can find the links to these mods in the [**Discord**](https://discord.geopolmc.org).

Alternatively, you can install the modpack from the [**Curseforge page**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/geopol), but you will need to manually import the zip file into your launcher.

(We are also working on a [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) page)
