# Joining

**There are currently 3 ways to join our server.**

## General Information

We provide modpacks to our players to ease the joining process. Currently we have 2 versions:
- **Normal** (Includes every required mod and the custom scripts)
- **Extras** (Features in Normal + Multiple optimization mods to help the client performance)

These can only be found on the [**Discord**](https://discord.geopolmc.org). The modpacks get updated regularly. When this happens, everyone has to redownload and import them again in their preferred launcher. More on this below.

We will apply for an official modpack on Curseforge after MW gets fully released. When this happens, it will be available right from the Curseforge search bar.

## Curseforge

The easiest way to install our modpacks is through Curseforge. You can find the CF downloads in the [Discord](https://discord.geopolmc.org). After installing CF and selecting Minecraft, click on the "**Create Custom Profile**" text next to the search bar. After this, there is a clickable import text at the top. From here, you can import the downloaded files and start playing, once it finishes downloading. (This requires you to login to Cursefore with your Microsoft account.)

Beware: We create multiple versions of our modpacks so only look out for the CF versions.

## GDLauncher

Both GDLauncher and the modpack installation process is similar to Curseforge. This launcher is only facused on Minecraft, while CF manages mods for many more games.  

Beware: We create multiple versions of our modpacks so only look out for the GD versions.
