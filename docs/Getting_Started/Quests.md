# Quests
Quests are a way to track your progress in the game. They are divided into chapters, and each chapter has a set of tasks to complete. You can see your progress in the quest book, which is located in the top right corner of your inventory.

These quests help the you to progress or give you a goal, if you feel lost. They also give you rewards, such as items, money, experience and more.

## Bounty Board

The Bounty Board is a place where you can get rewards for slaying mobs, players and bosses. The board has a few repeatable quests too, if you want to farm quests for specific drops.
