# Quests
Quests are a way to track your progress in the game. They are divided into chapters, and each chapter has a set of tasks to complete. You can see your progress in the quest book, which is located in the top right corner of your inventory.

These quests help the players to progress or give them a goal, if they feel lost. They also give you rewards, such as items, money, experience and more.

After your first join, you will be automatically assigned to your FTB Team and will be able to complete quests.

## Bounty Board

The Bounty Board is a place where you can get reward for slaying mobs, players and bosses. This chapter has a few repeatable quests too, if you want to get more mob specific drops.
