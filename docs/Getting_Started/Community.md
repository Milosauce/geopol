## Support us

Currently GeoPol is a non-profit server. We do not have any plans to monetize the server. However, we do have a [Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/geopolmc), here you can make one-time donations or even subscribe to a monthly payment. We will use the money to pay for the server and premium features. These help us make a more stable and enjoyable enviroment.
