# Strategies 
This article will be more on the strategies of battles so player may learn from mistakes. 

## V.1
There were few battles during V.1 so only one strategy was employed
### Medieval Seiges 
When players seigeing a base do not have the recorces or tools to break through defences, they may be forced to "wait out" there enemies. For a effective seige, players must "quarantine" and completely surround the base. If the base borders a water way, players may try to slip out and get the drop on you          

If being seiged, make sure you planned ahead, animals are easy for attackers to kill, and farms are easy for attacker to watch over. Your base should be built with doors at any doorway, a closed door can stop a push in its tracks. Covered firing positions can let you harass and even kill attackers.     

## V.2
### Bombardment and Rush 
Bombardment is the act of long range shelling to weaken or "soften up" defences before approching. This is highly effective as walls seem to not work as well with holes in them. When pushing in, spread out so a grenade or LMG spray cant put a end everyone. Make sure to approch fast, as the time during approch can let enemies repair. 

If being bombarded, reflect on the good investment it was to build you loot room so far below ground. If the shelling is sporadic, repair critical defences and machines. When the rush comes, hold as many rooms as possible with your loot room being to "core" and final room that will have to be taken. Communication will be important on both sides, friendly fire hurts. Make sure not to talk over your teammates, they may be giving valuable intel.  

### Total Destruction 
Retreats from a Bombardment and Rush usually turn into Total Destructions, if the attacker has the ammo. Defenders must counterattack to save there base from destruction, if there loot isnt blastproof.     

## V.3 Beta

### "Honorable" Duels
Dueling can solve small problems, if the factions will cooperate. Send two members per faction, one dueler and one mediator. Give the duelers a single shot weapon and a plenty of ammo.
