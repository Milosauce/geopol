# Map

The map is based on realistic terrain, created with the [Vanilla Vistas](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vanilla-vistas) preset and OTG. You can find any sort of terrain, from flat plains to mountain ranges, whilst also being able to find vanilla features, such as mineshafts and dungeons.

### World Border

The world border is currently set to **1750 blocks** from the spawn. This is to prevent players from exploring too far away from the spawn, and to prevent lag. The world border will be expanded in the future, but not too much, as we want to keep the map small and compact to have centralized battles and factions.
## Nether/End

**The Nether is disabled** on our server. You can find all of the materials in the shop.

**The End is enabled**. You can even find some custom loot in the End Cities.
## Dynmap

Dynmap is a plugin that allows you to see the map of your server in real time. It's very useful for finding your way around the server. You can also see the map on the website [here](https://map.geopolmc.org). 

Our map displays the following:
- Player list
- No player locations
- Top-down view
- Bird's eye view
- Only the overworld
- Faction claims
- World border
- Spawn
- One-way chat from the server to the map
- *Sadly no modded blocks*
