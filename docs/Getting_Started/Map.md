# Map

The map is based on realistic terrain, created with OTG. You can find any sort of terrain, from flat plains to mountain ranges, whilst also being able to find vanilla features, such as mineshafts and dungeons.


## Dynmap

Dynmap is a plugin that allows you to see the map of your server in real time. It's very useful for finding your way around the server. You can also see the map on the website [here](https://map.geopolmc.org).
