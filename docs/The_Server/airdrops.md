# Airdrops

Every hour, the military will fly out an airdrop to a random location in the world and broadcast the coordinates. These airdrops contain useful supplies for survivors including gunpowder, metal, coal, food, money, and guns. Although these supplies can be tempting, players should keep in mind that opening an airdrop will set off another broadcast.
