# Airdrops

Every hour, the military will fly out an airdrop to a random location in the world and broadcast the coordinates. These airdrops contain useful supplies for survivors including gunpowder, metal, coal, food, money, and guns. Although these supplies can be tempting, players should keep in mind that opening an airdrop will set off another broadcast.

Note: airdrops get cleared after every server restart

## Military Airdrops

For every 8 airdrops, one of them is a special kind called a "Military Airdrop". These airdrops are equiped with a parachute and take time to fall to the ground. Unlike normal airdrops, military airdrops are completely filled with supplies for an army. You will find vehicle frames and their corrosponding engines, money, large amounts of copper, gunmetal, and steel, as well as diamonds, assault rifles, vests, and combat armor. The loot does not come without risk however, as the coordinates are broadcast 10 minutes before the airdrop hits the ground, which could give opposing teams time to get there before you.
