title: The Map
---
# World Gen

The map is based on realistic terrain, created with the [Vanilla Vistas](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vanilla-vistas) preset and OTG. You can find any sort of terrain, from flat plains to mountain ranges, whilst also being able to find vanilla features, such as mineshafts and dungeons.

### World Border

The world border is currently set to **8000 blocks** from the spawn. This is to stop players from exploring too far away from the spawn, and to prevent lag. The world border may be expanded in the future, but not too much, as we want to keep the map compact to have more centralized battles and factions.
### Dimensions

***The Nether is disabled*** You can find all of the materials in the shop.

***The End is enabled*** ~~You can even find some custom loot in the End Cities.~~ (Coming soon)
## Dynamic Map

The Dynamic Map (Dynmap) is a plugin that allows you to see the map of our server in real time, and  it's very useful for finding your way around the server. You can view the map on our website [here](https://map.geopolmc.org). 

Our map displays the following:
- Player list
- No player locations
- Top-down view and Isometric view
- Only the Overworld
- Faction claims
- World border
- Spawn's location 
- One-way chat display from the server to the map
- *Sadly no modded blocks*
