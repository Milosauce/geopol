# Joining

**There are currently 3 ways to join our server.**

## General Information

We provide modpacks to our players to ease the joining process. Currently we have 2 versions:
- **Normal** (Includes every required mod and the custom scripts)
- **Extras** (Features in Normal + Multiple optimization mods to help the client performance)

These can only be found on the [**Discord**](https://discord.geopolmc.org). The modpacks get updated regularly. When this happens, everyone has to redownload and import them again in their preferred launcher.

We will apply for an official modpack on Curseforge after MW gets fully released.

## Curseforge

The easiest way to install our modpacks is through Curseforge. You can find the CF downloads in the [Discord](https://discord.geopolmc.org). Beware: We create multiple versions of our modpacks so only look out for the CF versions.

## GDLauncher

Beware: We create multiple versions of our modpacks so only look out for the GD versions.
