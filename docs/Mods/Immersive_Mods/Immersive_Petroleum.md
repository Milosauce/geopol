# Immersive Petroleum

Immersive Petroleum is a lightweight content add-on for Immersive Engineering that introduces oil, oil extraction, and oil processing to the mod's tech progression.

## Oil

To utilize Immersive Petroleum, players must first locate an oil deposit buried deep belowground, trapped under a thick layer of Bedrock. The Core Sample Drill can be used to detect these reservoirs. Once a source of oil is discovered, **Pumpjacks** can be built to pump the **Crude Oil** to the surface.

## Machines and Processing

Using the large **Distillation Tower** multiblock, Crude Oil is heated to separate it into layers of varying boiling points. From the Crude Oil input, the structure produces Diesel, Gasoline, Lubricant, and Bitumen. 

**Diesel** acts as a less environmentally friendly but longer-burning alternative to **Biodiesel**, whereas **Gasoline** can fuel the included **Motorboat** and **Portable Generators**. **Lubricant** allows you to speed up your machines. **Bitumen** is a gooey byproduct that's used in **Asphalt** paving.
