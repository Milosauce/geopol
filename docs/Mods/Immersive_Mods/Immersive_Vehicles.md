# Immersive Vehicles
Immersive vehicles, formerly known as Minecraft Transport Simulator, is a pack based vehicle mod that adds vehicles to Minecraft. 

### Packs?
Yes, packs. Whilst Immersive Vehicles does have a default pack, which is also installed on our server, independent creators can make their own packs. GeoPol features the following packs:

 - Immersive Vehicles (MTS/IV) - Official Content Pack
 - UNU Civilian Vehicles
 - UNU Military Vehicles
 - UNU Parts Pack
 - IAV Parts pack
 - VEB Automobilwerke Schwikau
 - Hero Aviation Helicopter Pack



### How do I get a vehicle?

You need to craft parts, such as engines, and then assemble the vehicle itself. This may take a longer period of time, depending on what kind of vehicle you are looking for. If you are only looking for something to traverse the map with, you can build an oak plane included in the Official Content Pack, which will will do the job.
### Civilian Vehicles
Crafting everyday cars and simple planes is, well, simple. You can craft parts for them in workbenches. These vehicles are cheaper in terms of resources.

### Military Vehicles
Military vehicles, such as tanks, are a different story. They are expensive, their munition is also expensive, but the payoff is worth the resources. You can employ combined arms attacks or defenses. V3 currently has tanks, BTRs, IFVs, attack helicopters and jets, most of them from  the Schwikau pack.

You can also craft stationary artillery, or tow said artillery.
