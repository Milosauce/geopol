---

Immersive Engineering is one of the major tech pillars in our server. It features a wide range of machines and tools that can be used to automate and improve your base. It also adds of new blocks and items, which can be used to create other materials from different mods due to our [recipe changes](https://docs.geopolmc.org/docs/Getting_Started/Recipe_Changes). We also have [Quests](https://docs.geopolmc.org/docs/Getting_Started/Quests) for this mod, which can be found on the server.

## Note on Energy

Immersive Engineering's unit of Forge Energy is Immersive Flux (IF), which integrates seamlessly with Redstone Fluxâ€“based power systems, exchanging IF for RF at a 1:1 ratio, which is required to power other mods' machines, like the [Refined Storage](https://docs.geopolmc.org/docs/Mods/Refined_Storage) controller.

## Getting Started

The Engineer's Manual is one of the most useful items in Immersive Engineering. It is an in-game guide to the mod, and contains information on all of the crazy blocks and items Immersive Engineering adds. You'll also want an Engineer's Hammer. This handy tool can be used for a lot of things.
