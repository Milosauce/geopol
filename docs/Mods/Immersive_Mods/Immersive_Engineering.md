title: Immersive Engineering
---

Immersive Engineering is one of the major tech pillars in our server. It features a wide range of machines and tools that can be used to automate and improve your base. It also adds of new blocks and items, which can be used to create other materials from different mods due to our [recipe changes](https://docs.geopolmc.org/docs/Getting_Started/Recipe_Changes). We also have [Quests](https://docs.geopolmc.org/docs/Getting_Started/Quests) for this mod, which can be found on the server. *This page is heavily based on the [official documentation](https://ftb.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Immersive_Engineering)*

## Note on Energy

Immersive Engineering's unit of Forge Energy is Immersive Flux (IF), which integrates seamlessly with Redstone Fluxâ€“based power systems, exchanging IF for RF at a 1:1 ratio, which is required to power other mods' machines, like the [Refined Storage](https://docs.geopolmc.org/docs/Mods/Refined_Storage) controller.

## Getting Started

The Engineer's Manual is one of the most useful items in Immersive Engineering. It is an in-game guide to the mod, and contains information on all of the crazy blocks and items Immersive Engineering adds. You'll also want an Engineer's Hammer. This handy tool can be used for a lot of things.

## Resources

Immersive Engineering adds a couple of resources. Unlike other mods, Immersive Engineering isn't wimpy on using them; you'll want to collect as much ore as possible. This includes vanilla ores too, not just the ones listed below.
 - Copper Ore
 - Bauxite Ore (Aluminium)
 - Lead Ore
 - Silver Ore
 - Nickel Ore

## Getting Hot

What's the best way to get hot? By making a Crude Blast Furnace and a Coke Oven of course! The Crude Blast Furnace is used to make Steel, which you'll want a ton of. It also makes Slag, although that isn't as useful.

The Coke Oven makes Coal Coke and Creosote Oil. Coal Coke is pretty useful, but Creosote Oil is actually required to progress; you'll need Treated Wood for a lot of things.

You can make an Improved Blast Furnace after producing a bit of steel with your crude blast furnace. The improved version allows automated inputs and outputs.

## Electricity!

(RF) Redstone Flux is supposedly magical, but in Immersive Engineering it acts a bit like electricity. There are three voltages: **low**, **medium** and **high** at **256 IF/t**, **1024 IF/t**, and **4096 IF/t** respectively. Different voltages shouldn't connect; if they do, very bad things will happen.

There are Wire Connectors and Wire Coils. Wire Coils are what transmit RF, but they aren't actually blocks; they're entities. Wire Coils always require Wire Connectors to exist and to transmit power. Wire Connectors are actual blocks that exist in the world. There are also Wire Relays, which are used to split power between multiple Wire Coils.

From this point on, you'll want an Engineer's Wire Cutters. It's how you disconnect Wire Coils.
